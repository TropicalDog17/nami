# Core Business Logic

Central processing components for transaction parsing and context management.

## Components

- **`parser.ts`** - Extracts structured transaction data from natural language input
- **`grounding.ts`** - Manages conversation context and account/tag data from backend
- **`schemas.ts`** - Zod schemas for transaction validation and type safety

Processes raw text/images through AI analysis, context enrichment, and structured data extraction to generate validated transaction data for backend submission.
