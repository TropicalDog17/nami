## Test Utilities

### Common Functions (test-utils.js)

The `test-utils.js` file provides reusable utilities for test scenarios:

- `waitForBackendReady()` - Waits for backend to be ready with retry logic
- `handleFormSubmission()` - Handles form submissions with error handling
- `createTestData()` - Creates unique test data to avoid conflicts
- `handleDialogConfirmation()` - Handles dialog confirmations
- `waitForElementVisible()` - Waits for elements to be visible with retry
- `takeScreenshotOnFailure()` - Takes screenshots on test failures
- `retryWithBackoff()` - Retries functions with exponential backoff
- `waitForNetworkIdle()` - Waits for network requests to complete
- `handleBackendOffline()` - Handles backend offline states

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Backend Server**: Must be running externally (not managed by Playwright):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```
   The backend runs on port 8080 and is assumed to be running throughout the test suite.

2. **Frontend Server**: Automatically started by Playwright:
   ```bash
   # Frontend will be started automatically by Playwright on port 3000
   ```

3. Install Playwright browsers (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run test:e2e:install
   ```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run all tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests with debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View test report
npm run test:e2e:report

# Clean test results
npm run test:e2e:clean

# Update Playwright
npm run test:e2e:update
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test --grep "Admin CRUD Operations"

# Run specific test with debug
npx playwright test --grep "should create a new transaction" --debug

# Run tests with specific project
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Test Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (playwright.config.js)

- **Timeouts**: Increased timeouts for better reliability
  - Navigation timeout: 30s
  - Test timeout: 60s
  - Action timeout: 10s

- **Retries**: 
  - CI environment: 3 retries
  - Development environment: 2 retries

- **Reporting**:
  - HTML report with screenshots
  - JSON report for CI integration
  - List reporter for console output

- **Web Server**:
  - Automatic frontend server startup (port 3000)
  - Backend server must be running externally (port 8080)
  - Server reuse in development
  - 120s startup timeout

### Global Setup and Teardown

#### Global Setup (global-setup.js)

- Verifies backend server is running (externally managed)
- Fails fast if backend is not accessible
- Cleans up any existing test data
- Prepares test environment

#### Global Teardown (global-teardown.js)

- Cleans up test data only
- Backend server remains running
- Removes test entities from database
- Does not stop any servers

## Test Data Management

### Creating Test Data

Use the `createTestData()` utility to generate unique test data:

```javascript
const testData = createTestData('transaction');
// Returns: { name: "transaction_123456789_123", description: "Test transaction created at 2024-09-26T10:30:45.123Z", timestamp: 123456789, randomSuffix: 123 }
```

### Test Data Cleanup

The global teardown automatically cleans up:
- Transaction types with "test" or "e2e" in name
- Accounts with "test" or "e2e" in name
- Assets with "test" or "e2e" in name
- Tags with "test" or "e2e" in name
- Transactions with "test" or "e2e" in notes

## Backend Connectivity Handling

### Backend Server Assumption

Tests assume the backend server is running externally and fail fast if not available:

1. **Detection**: Checks for backend connectivity at test startup
2. **Fail Fast**: Tests will not run if backend is offline
3. **External Management**: Backend server lifecycle is managed outside Playwright
4. **Clear Instructions**: Provides specific commands to start backend if needed

### Retry Logic

- **Exponential Backoff**: Retries with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
- **Maximum Retries**: 3 attempts before failing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network and API errors

## Test Scenarios

### Admin CRUD Tests

- **Display Tests**: Verify all tabs and sections are visible
- **Navigation Tests**: Switch between tabs and verify state
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete operations
- **Form Validation**: Test required fields and error handling
- **Filtering**: Test search and filter functionality
- **Data Consistency**: Verify data persistence between tabs

### Transaction Flow Tests

- **Empty States**: Verify proper empty state handling
- **Form Operations**: Test transaction creation and editing
- **Currency Views**: Test USD/VND currency switching
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, update, delete transactions
- **Navigation**: Test navigation between sections

### Reports Functionality Tests

- **Tab Switching**: Test navigation between report types
- **Currency Views**: Test USD/VND currency switching
- **Date Filtering**: Test date range and preset filters
- **Data Display**: Verify proper data rendering
- **Empty States**: Test handling of no data scenarios
- **Export Functionality**: Test data export features

## Debugging Tests

### Screenshot on Failure

Tests automatically take screenshots when they fail:
- Saved to `test-results/` directory
- Named with test name and timestamp
- Full page screenshots for context

### Console and Network Logging

Tests log detailed information:
- Console messages (last 5 messages)
- Network requests (last 3 requests)
- Network responses (last 3 responses)
- Error details and stack traces

### Debug Mode

Run tests with debug mode for step-by-step execution:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Best Practices

### Test Writing

1. **Use Test Utilities**: Leverage existing utilities for common scenarios
2. **Unique Test Data**: Always use `createTestData()` for unique identifiers
3. **Proper Timeouts**: Use appropriate timeouts and waits
4. **Error Handling**: Handle both success and error scenarios
5. **Cleanup**: Ensure tests clean up after themselves

### Test Organization

1. **Logical Grouping**: Group related tests in describe blocks
2. **Clear Names**: Use descriptive test names
3. **Independent Tests**: Each test should work in isolation
4. **Setup/Teardown**: Use beforeEach/afterEach for test state

### Backend Reliability

1. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry for transient failures
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle offline states gracefully
3. **Network Handling**: Wait for network idle when appropriate
4. **Error Boundaries**: Set appropriate error boundaries

## CI/CD Integration

### Running Tests in CI

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npm run test:e2e:install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
      - name: Upload report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Test Reporting

- **HTML Report**: Interactive report for local viewing
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable results for CI
- **JUnit Report**: Compatible with various CI systems
- **Screenshots**: Automatic capture on failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Server Not Running**:
   - Tests will fail immediately if backend is not accessible
   - Start backend manually: `cd backend && go run cmd/server/main.go`
   - Backend must run on port 8080 (not managed by Playwright)
   - Verify network connectivity and firewall settings

2. **Test Failures**:
   - Run tests in headed mode for visual debugging
   - Check screenshots for failure context
   - Review console and network logs

3. **Flaky Tests**:
   - Increase timeouts
   - Add more explicit waits
   - Check for race conditions

4. **Element Not Found**:
   - Verify selectors are correct
   - Check for dynamic content loading
   - Use waitForElementVisible utility

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Run specific failing test with debug
npx playwright test --grep "failing test name" --debug

# Run with trace for detailed execution
npx playwright test --trace on

# Run with video recording
npx playwright test --video=retain-on-failure
```
